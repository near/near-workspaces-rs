# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/near/near-workspaces-rs/compare/near-workspaces-v0.7.0...near-workspaces-v0.8.0) - 2023-10-04

- [**breaking**] renamed crate to near-workspaces to avoid confusion with Cargo workspaces; imports should now use `near_workspaces` instead of just `workspaces` ([#318](https://github.com/near/near-workspaces-rs/pull/318))
- [Upgraded to Rust Stable Toolchain](https://github.com/near/near-workspaces-rs/commit/8d93197d06aee2a426b6da99e270ce1658c2cd4f). Deprecates requirement of only using rustc-1.69 and lower.

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- [`view_*` asynchronous builders have been added which provides being able to query from a specific block hash or block height](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs/pull/218)
- [`{CallTransaction, Transaction}::transact_async` for performing transactions without directly having to wait for it complete it on chain](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs/pull/222)
- [`view_chunk` added for querying into chunk related info on the network.](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs/pull/234)
  - Adds `Chunk` and `ChunkHeader` type to reference specific chunk info.
- [`Error::{simple, message, custom}` are now public and usable for custom errors](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs/pull/224)

### Changed

- [Apart of the changes from adding `view_*` async builders, we have a couple breaking changes to the `view_*` functions](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs/pull/218):
  - `{Account, Contract, Worker}::view_state` moved `prefix` parameter into builder. i.e.
    ```
    worker.view_state("account_id", Some(prefix)).await?;
    // is now
    worker.view_state("account_id")
        .prefix(prefix)
        .await?;
    // if prefix was `None`, then simply delete the None argument.
    ```
  - `view` function changed to be a builder, and no longer take in `args` as a parameter. It instead has been moved to the builder side.
  - Changed `Worker::view_latest_block` to `Worker::view_block` as the default behavior is equivalent.
  - `operations::Function` type no longer takes a lifetime parameter.
  - `operations::CallTransaction` type takes one less lifetime parameter.
- [`Worker::call` signature changed to be more in line with `view_*` async builders. It will now return a builder like `{Account, Contract}::call`](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs/pull/245)
  - This `call` no longer accepts `Contract` since that was not as accessible. Instead a `InMemorySigner` is now required to sign transactions (which can be retrieved from `{Account, Contract}::signer` or `InMemorySigner::{from_secret_key, from_file}`).
  - `{Account, Contract}::signer` now exposed.

### Fixed

- [Changed the docs to reflect proper size of of rate limits on near.org RPC](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs/pull/219)
- [Cached nonces now are per account-id and public-key instead of just public-key](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs/pull/231)
  - this didn't matter if only one KeyPair was being used per account, but could be problematic when there were multiple KeyPairs per account utilizing the same nonces.
- [Error message context wasn't being exposed properly by sandbox, so this fixed it](https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs/pull/236)

- internal dependencies like near-jsonrpc-client upgraded to 0.4.0 from 0.4.0-beta: https://github.com/near/workspaces-rs/pull/210
  - Note, the RNG for `SecretKey::{from_random, from_seed}(KeyType::SECP256K1, ...)` has been changed as well, and will produce different keys than before.
