// This example shows how to use the `near_abi_client` Generation Based API.
// We are generating client code using the schema for the ABI and and `workspaces-rs` to call into the contract.
// More information about usage can be found here: <https://github.com/near/near-abi-client-rs/blob/main/README.md>
//
// A good scenario for usage might be when you are interacting with a contract or multiple contracts at an automated level
// and you want to have a type-safe way of interacting with them.

/// The generated api requires setup in the `build.rs` file to generate the client code.
